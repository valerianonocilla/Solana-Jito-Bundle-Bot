## Script Functions

Execute these steps in sequential order. After executing each step, verify the transaction bundle has landed by checking the first included transaction on Jito Explorer.

**A) Create Keypairs**

Run this step as needed, not necessarily for every launch. Ensure the existent keypairs hold no SOL before proceeding because this will override them with new keypairs.

**B) Premarket**

Execute steps 2 through 6 in order. If a bundle does not land, re-execute the step with a higher tip. Step 1 is optional because you can create a market through other methods as well.

**C) Create Pool**

Repeatedly invoke the pool creation & bundling function. Increasing the tip and repeated attempts are recommended due to Solana congestion at peak times.

**D) Sell Features**

After the pool is live, proceed to either:

* Sell all keypairs at once and reclaim WSOL in the subsequent step.
* Gradually sell portions of the token supply on demand. This process involves transferring a percentage of each keypair's token balance to the fee payers and selling it all in one bundle.

**E) LP Removal**

This step removes liquidity from the market(if LP tokens are not burned)
